Knowing How People BehaveIt‚Äôs people who read your tweets.It‚Äôs people who buy the products you‚Äôre promoting.It has nothing to do with forcing followers to join some weird ""pyramid scheme""It‚Äôs about understanding people and acting accordingly.2. Knowing How The Platform BehavesTwitter has an internal mechanism, the ""algorithm""When you understand how the algorithm works‚Ä¶You can ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù it to get more engagement.(Nothing to do with hope,¬†luck or throwing around hundreds of affiliate links).It‚Äôs more about getting real traction, as I show you in my system.Master these two,And you'll have more people watching your promos, more clicks on your links...And sales pouring in‚Ä¶ like this: (BTW: No other affiliate marketer on Twitter has made as much money as I have selling other people‚Äôs products)To the point, even Gumroad recommends my strategy: And there‚Äôs a reason.They recommend my strategy because it works.The best part?You can master it in less time than it takes to write a thread.And to get sales with this strategy, you don‚Äôt need to be:‚Ä¢ A creative guy‚Ä¢ A superb writer‚Ä¢ A native English speaker‚Ä¢ A Twitter celebrity (nor be a friend of the famous guys)With the ""Twitter Affiliate Mastery Strategy""...Anyone Can Get Results Like These: No matter your follower count..Got his 1st sale with just 118 followers.No matter if you‚Äôre new to Twitter..Made his first affiliate sale 2 weeks after creating his account.Or if you need to do other things..This is @LeadLifeSimply making sales while having fun with his family.Enroll and get Instant Access to 9 modules you can read in one sitting with everything you need to become wildly successful:#1 The affiliate marketing truth: - Discover how affiliates really make sales.#2 Getting the keys:- How to get added as an affiliate for the courses people love to buy.#3 The Plug-&-Earn strategy revealed: - How to turn a simple Tweet into real money.#4 Becoming an affiliate master: - Steal the ""timing secret"" of the biggest affiliates.#5 Maximizing link clicks: - Two easy steps to 3x your link clicks and 2x your sales.#6 Effortless promotion creation: - Proven promotions you can copy & paste to get crazy sales.#7 Making your link irresistible: - How to make people feel an uncontrollable urge to buy from you (and only from you).#8 Sniper posting:- A counterintuitive way to sell without worrying about engagement.9# Other Tips & Tricks: - Advanced affiliated strategies to earn $3000, $4000, or even $5000/month from your Twitter account.

Prospecting Pathway - The #1 method of booking meetings for BDRs	Add to cartSize539 KBLength5 pages	Look, when you‚Äôre selling B2B services:You're only one cold email, Linkedin message, or call away from what you need...But that‚Äôs ONLY if you know how to:SCRAPE the contact info of any prospect you want - no matter what niche you‚Äôre in‚Ä¶WRITE irresistible cold emails that‚Äôll get any prospect on a call/zoom with you‚Ä¶AUTOMATE your outreach so that you can book 5, 10 or even 20 sales calls a week without lifting a finger so your reply rates for MEETINGS look like this per week...And in this content, I‚Äôm going to reveal the exact framework that hundreds of BDRs have used to achieve all of the above‚Ä¶But just before I get into that, I‚Äôll let you in on a secret.In this BDR role, there‚Äôs ONE factor that determines how successful you‚Äôre going to be:Your prospecting pathway.That‚Äôs right.I figured this out while owning an email marketing agency for 2 years. After that I joined a large tech startup as a BDR for a piece of equity and long term career opportunity.Your prospecting pathway could quite literally be the difference between getting promoted to AE, or having to find a new role elsewhere. I'm already pegged for promotion to AE once I reach the tenure criteria, just off of doing this method for 6 months.So before I introduce the prospecting pathway, let me ask you a question.Are you in true control of your prospecting?Do you know for a fact where your next meeting is going to come from?If you answered no‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre in for a treat.And yes, I can email any prospect, in any niche, and sell nearly any B2B product to them.( It‚Äôs basically a superpower )There are no ‚Äúemail blasts‚Äù.There are no black hat methods or scams.It‚Äôs a single, fundamental system that allows you to find your target customer, get them on the phone, and hit your quotas - on AUTOPILOT.I'm giving this out because I've realized how many people need help with prospecting! I love to help others and the information that I've gathered over the years is super valuable. So I want to share it with others and that way EVERYBODY EATS. Any BDR in B2B sales will benefit from this.I wasn't always good at prospecting...During those hard times where I couldn‚Äôt get a single positive response‚Ä¶I thought:Cold Email/call = Ineffective Bullsh*tAnd I‚Äôm pretty certain there are a lot of people who think the same.But the truth is‚Ä¶People only claim that ‚Äúcold email is useless‚Äù because they do the following:Blast some blind, crappy email with a generic template to thousands of people.And that‚Äôs not only ineffective‚Ä¶But it‚Äôs disrespectful to your prospect - and more importantly - it doesn‚Äôt work.Here's some recent results from one of the early students.Then folks not even in my vertical started to reach out wondering about my strategy..So how did I go from getting no replies to mastering prospecting? Having people ask me for prospect help weekly? Teaching entire sales teams across different verticals?After thousands of thousands of email blasts and cold calls, I knew I had to change my approach.I was desperate.So I started testing things. Like a mad scientist.What if I use this angle with this CTA?What if I mix this‚Ä¶ with this‚Ä¶?What if I change this setting in my email provider?And then‚Ä¶.One day it happened.¬†Two positive responses arrived in my inbox.I pinched myself to make sure I hadn‚Äôt just dreamt of those replies.I was ecstatic.So I doubled down on my new technique‚Ä¶And guess what happened?MORE positive replies in my inbox.Now fast forward to this exact moment‚Ä¶you're about to uncover how to be at the top of the leaderboard and crush quotas like never before!(FYI-S2s are validated sales opps)The Prospecting Pathway is so powerful, yet so easy to implement‚Ä¶You could almost call it ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù.Here‚Äôs a peak of what you get after your purchase:‚úîÔ∏è Book - Prospecting Pathway‚úîÔ∏è Video - Writing scripts‚úîÔ∏è Video - Linkedin Messaging that converts‚úîÔ∏è Video - Scraping enterprise contacts‚úîÔ∏è Video - Finding brand new prospects on Sales Nav‚úîÔ∏è Video - How to quickly do research on high value prospects - Personalization‚úîÔ∏è Video - Automated Workflow + Platform we use‚úîÔ∏è Video - Summary So, how much does it cost?¬†As you can imagine‚Ä¶ something this powerful is NOT going to be free for long.I gave away the first 50 downloads for free and after getting the feedback and reviews...I made it a price that I know it is worth.But before you come to a decision‚Ä¶I want to remind you that NOT implementing the prospecting pathway is going to cost you BIG in 2023.If you don‚Äôt implement this strategy TODAY‚Ä¶Not only are you missing out on as many sales opps as you want each month‚Ä¶But you‚Äôre going to get LEFT IN THE DUST by all of your competition who DO take action.At this moment, the price of the course is $45.¬†I‚Äôm going to be constantly improving and upgrading the material so that‚Äôll help you get more meetings and better commissions.And of course - All folks who purchase will receive ALL of the updates and additional models at no extra cost. Forever. It'll be available to you here on Gumroad.And so my promise to you is bold and simple‚Ä¶If You Don‚Äôt Book Meetings Using My Method within 60 Days, I Will Personally Refund 100% Of Your Money.¬†Now that might seem like a downright STUPID offer (for me) - but that‚Äôs how confident I am in the system. It's been so good that our head of sales development Alex, is now going to give it to new hires.If you genuinely implement my systems for 60 days and STILL don‚Äôt book more meetings - email me personally at hooperjeffrey44@gmail.com and I‚Äôll send you back 100% of your money. Requests must be made within 60 days.So there you have it. A sure fire way to become one of the best BDRs in your company and a money back guarantee if you don't find this useful. Shall we get to work now?	103	350

Anyone else that may be working within Figma. If you don't want to waste time and speed up your entire process, this is what you need.Why we created Shipfaster UI?Since Michael (founder of The Designership) formed his very first design agency back in 2014, he realised the importance of having a scalable and re-usable design system. The only way we were able to run 5-10 projects in parallel was a well managed design system.However there were too many design systems on the market that lacked quality, scalability and utility. Shipfaster UI has been carefully crafted from all the mistakes, failures and learnings we've made over the years. Changelog15th Jun, 2022 (v.2.3)Figma made some major updates to their platform in May 2022. This included component properties, a re-designed Autolayout, dark mode and much more. In v.2.3 of Shipfaster UI, we have decided to introduce a number of updates that have helped improve the kit‚Äôs performance and it‚Äôs relevancy with the latest updates.Removed .styled components to improve the performance of our design system.Updated all components with the new component properties and Autolayout feature.Updated all templates with the revised components.Migrated our icon system from ‚Äòcomponent variants‚Äô to individual components, to allow for an improved toggling experience.Added tablet and mobile versions for all templates.Provided pre-designed templates for quick use.Included a Shipfaster Starter template for anyone that wants to use a lighter version of our design system.4th Mar, 2022 (v2.2)A few members reported seeing ‚Äò3 missing libraries‚Äô upon importing the design system.Fixed mission libraries issue.5th Feb, 2022 (v2.1)We realised there was a small issue with some members not being able to load all the images in the design file. What we have learnt is that Figma is a browser-based app which means it‚Äôs subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab, including those in the desktop app. When loading or editing Figma files nears or or exceeds this memory limit, it can cause performance issues like long load times, crashes and others. Please keep in mind when using our design system, to limit the number of browser tabs you have opened.Updated file thumbnails.Moved checkboxes, radio buttons and toggles into a new section called Form Controls.Compressed all JPG images in the file to reduce file size.Members that raised images not loading have confirmed this has solved their issues.Jan 17th, 2021Today we‚Äôre excited to announce the launch of our Shipfaster UI - A Figma Design System 2.0 üéâ This is our first major upgrade and overhaul to our design system.150+ new global design styles.2,800+ new media assets.6,000+ components and variants.140+ template examples.Written instructions for every key component.Master components provided with all primary components.Any questions?Something else?

What is the difference between Hard Ops and Boxcutter?HardOps is a toolkit that encompasses more than just modelling. There are tools pertaining to rendering, mirroring, inserts and even sculpting tools. This is the core of my workflow in Blender and is recommended for anyone doing Hard Surface or just wants to use Blender much more efficiently. Boxcutter is just a cutter. However, by just a cutter we mean this tool is focused on being the fastest and easy to use 3d view cut tool. If you love Hard Ops then Boxcutter is just another piece of the workflow. Drawing cuts and having real-time feedback is truly the next level of the workflow. By design these tools work best together. But they are loved equally. What if I already have these products? Any duplicate purchases will go towards development, hiring random coders, and pizzas for homeless / disadvantaged CG artists. Not to mention helping fund Blender and improving the experience as a whole.Our hope is to never stop attempting to improve upon ideas until everything is as streamlined as possible.We hope you choose our product.

We tried a bunch of Figma UI kits, but found they lacked in size, flexibility, or quality ‚Äî usually all three ‚Äî and we ended up having to remake all the poor-quality components.We needed an ‚Äúultimate starter‚Äù kit for new freelance projects and design systems, rather than having to start from scratch each time. We were sick of rebuilding the same common components over and over again... which is not only a waste of time, but the most boring part of the design process.Untitled UI was built to solve this. We‚Äôve thought of everything you need to design modern and beautiful UI and websites and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package.You can use this UI kit in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way ‚Äî to be as neutral, flexible, and scalable as possible to use as a kick-starter for any project.Any questions?Check out our¬†Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.Note: Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma's team, nor is it endorsed by Figma."	1370	119

It has taken me a while to crack role icons, for example, but with this product I can finally say I have them nailed (IMO!).This product originally started as an idea for a YouTube video, where I was going to tailor it to beginners, but I have since taken it to heights I never even imagined. I have worked very hard with the intention of helping everyone out ‚Äî whether you're just starting out and want help with the basics, or maybe you just want the best server-making assets in one place, I have got you covered! From those beginning their server-making journey, to the most experienced who crave the perfect server, I am here to help you. To be honest, I feel like many of the assets included are better than I have made for my server before. This collection of assets has been designed for passionate server makers who are looking to visually enhance their server. All assets in this resource, including emojis and role icons, have been personally designed from scratch with pixel-perfect care. I have been working hard to make these designs as attractive as possible, and everything has been made from scratch!Note to my YouTube audience & server members: If you have visited my server in the past year, you may have seen a #resources channel. This is that, but taken to a whole new level!NEW Update 1.9 released April 17, 2023*Update 1.9.1 released on April 28, fixes an issue where certain emojis and role icons were too big to upload. Apologies for the issue!Existing buyers are compensated with additional updates for free. Redownloading the pack is required in order to recieve updates.See what's newLet's see what the Server Making Assets Pack will provide you with:Beautify your information channels and express yourself with over 2000 emoji:Something as simple as an emoji can completely transform the look of your server and make it stand out from the rest!No more walls of text ‚Äî create beautiful lists with bullet points and subentries* (‚Ü≥) in tons of shapes and colors;Separate multiple sections of text or different topics with message dividers;Express yourself with response emojis ‚Äî from check marks to stars ‚Äî or grab attention with signs such as 'NEW' or 'ALERT';Say goodbye to static channels! Make your embeds dynamic and your reactions pop with animated emoji** ‚Äî consisting of dividers, bullet points, and response emojis!*Subentries are lines or brackets that expand upon bullet points, supplying the reader with further details.Get the most out of your boosts with covers and over 140*** role icons**:Spice up your roles and make your members feel special with tons of role icons for your staff, VIPs, boosters, bots, or even your muted members;Branding is everything. Give your server a unique look and theme with covers (invite backgrounds / server banners)Branding is everything ‚Äî save time and effort with templates and hundreds of premade assets:You don't need a graphic design degree to make something breathtaking. At least not anymore, thanks to Server Making Assets Pack! Templates included are designed to give you the chance to make something unique to your server without the years of experience. Or, save time with premade assets!Every good server needs a logo, and not something made in Paint. Choose from various unique logo templates or pick your favorite color from almost a thousand high quality premade icons;Present your channels in an organized, eye-catching way with headers ‚Äî separate messages or embeds and divide an information channel up into sections.Spice up your channels with invisible spaces in the form of Characters:With the use of special characters, we can space text and emojis apart in text channel names.When using emojis in text channels, it is generally advised to space them apart from the text. This way you avoid squashed looking channels where the wording is not spaced from the emoji. You may also wish to space multiple words apart without relying on the default hypens (the lines that appear when you try to put normal spaces).The special characters provided allow you to do both these things thanks to the invisible whitespace around them, giving the illusion of spaces.The best designs require the right colors:To make your roles and artwork stand out, you need to use the right colors.There are many colors and gradients that you can choose from in this pack. Role dividers require an exact color code to appear invisible, along with other UI elements such as user profile banners. These, however, vary between devices, making it hard to find the right color.Choose the best colors for your roles and server artwork;Select beautiful gradients, whether you prefer a vibrant, pastel, or dark look for your logos and designs;Use included UI colors to create 'invisible' role dividers, embeds without color strips, or to make your user banner invisible. Whether you use dark mode or light mode, desktop or iOS, all the colors are ready for you!Never run out of ideas for a role or server name again:It can become a headache trying to come up with cool names for your roles or server, or even the channels inside. With the Thesaurus**, you can pick from an endless collection of a thousand words, including some you may have never even thought of! If you're feeling exotic, there are various foreign/translated words to choose from as well. Sometimes you just need to spice things up.Catch eyes with the best fonts for your designs:Finding the right font for your server‚Äôs logo, headers, or covers, can be a difficult task. There is practically an infinite amount of fonts on the internet, and narrowing down to the best is not easy. Save the hassle and explore a packed list of incredible, bold, and stylish fonts, that I have used over the past several years.**Exclusive to the paid edition***58 plus visual variationsChoose your Server Making Assets PackThe Server Making Assets Pack consists of two editions:The free edition, titled 'Basic', includes the essential assets, such as some emojis, editable templates, Characters, and premade icons.The paid edition, titled 'Super', also includes assets for those who want to make their server the best it can be, such as a multitude of role icons, the thesaurus, and bullet points + sub-entries available in multiple shapes and colors.Please refer to the Basic vs Super edition comparison image to see exactly how both editions compare:Compare Basic & SuperThe Server Making Assets Pack includes, in detail:Editable header template (4)+ Premade headers ** (44)Editable server banner / invite background templates** (8)Editable server icon templates*** (8)+ Premade server icons (780*)Custom made emojis (2087* 1070) ***Role icons (265* 123 (58 unique)) ** for leveling roles, VIPs, boosters, punished users, bots (includes various bot types), members, staff, ownersColors (51)Gradients (29)UI colors (11) (includes dark mode, light mode, and iOS)Font recommendations (30* 22)Word thesaurus (1000) **Tip: Server Making Assets Pack also includes guides so you know exactly how to use bullet points and sub-entries, for example.*Expanded upon in the latest update**This resource is exclusive to Super***Some assets are exclusive to SuperPlease refer to the Basic vs Super edition comparison image for an extended breakdown:Compare Basic & SuperBefore you download or purchase Server Making Assets Pack, please read the terms and conditions:Learn about free product updates, how you may use this product, and more.Terms and Conditions	106	0

There are hundreds of icon libraries floating around the internet today, but the majority of them are low quality, buggy, overly stylized, or simply too small ‚Äî usually all of these.You don‚Äôt realize the power of a high-quality icon library until you start using one. A good icon library saves you time and money usually spent on meticulously creating icons one-by-one, or even worse, constantly fixing existing icons so they're more consistent and optically balanced.A good way to frame it is to ask the question, ‚Äúwill this icon library save me a few hours of work in a project?‚Äù If the answer is YES, it‚Äôs probably worth the investment. Then it becomes an asset you can use in unlimited future projects.We‚Äôve thought of everything you need for modern UI design and have wrapped it into one neatly organized package. Better yet, it's made for Figma, in Figma, which means they're carefully designed to be 100% compatible with Figma's latest 2022 component properties and override features.You can use this icon library in unlimited projects. In fact, we designed it this way ‚Äî Untitled UI Icons are designed to be 100% Figma native, consistent, professional quality, and neutral enough for any UI or web design project.How are Untitled UI Icons different?We get it. There are hundreds of icon packs. Why did we create another one?When we were building Untitled UI, we looked at dozens and dozens of open source and best-selling icon libraries. Some were good, but we found the vast majority lacked in quality, were overly stylized, or simply too small.The main problem was that not a single one was set up to respect component overrides in Figma. For example, when you use an icon in a component and change the stroke color, as soon as you swap out that icon instance, you'll lose those overrides and have to add the stroke color again. The same goes for fill colors, stroke weights, opacity etc.We realized we needed an ‚Äúultimate‚Äù icon library that was professional quality, but also big enough and neutral enough for any project, and designed to work seamlessly with Figma. We couldn't find an icon library we loved so we made one. Untitled UI Icons are made for Figma, in Figma, and tick all the boxes we were looking for. Basically, we made it for ourselves.Any questions?Check out our¬†Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.Note: Untitled UI is not affiliated with Figma or Figma's team, nor is it endorsed by Figma."	460	49
